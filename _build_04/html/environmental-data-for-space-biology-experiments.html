<p>The Environmental Data Application (EDA) provides users with convenient access to valuable data collected during the Rodent research missions. The application facilitates the exploration and analysis of this scientific data, offering a comprehensive view of the mission details, telemetry information, and relevant radiation-related metadata.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Mission Information:</strong> The EDA application provides detailed information about each Rodent research mission. This includes mission objectives, launch dates, spacecraft specifications, and key scientific instruments onboard the spacecraft. Users can easily access this information to gain an overview of the mission context and objectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Telemetry Data:</strong> Telemetry data, also known as engineering data, is crucial for monitoring the health and status of the spacecraft. The EDA application allows users to access and analyze this data, which includes information such as spacecraft temperatures, power levels, and attitude control parameters. Telemetry data is essential for assessing the performance of the spacecraft and identifying any potential issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Radiation-Related Metadata:</strong> Radiation is a significant factor in space exploration, and the Rodent research missions collected valuable data on radiation levels and effects. The EDA application provides radiation data, including information on radiation types, doses, and sources. This data is valuable for studying the effects of radiation on spacecraft components and biological organisms, such as rodents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The EDA application is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to researchers and the public alike. Users can easily navigate the application, search for specific data, and visualize the information through interactive plots and graphs. The application also provides documentation and tutorials to assist users in making the most of the available data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Export and Sharing:</strong> The EDA application allows users to export the data they need for further analysis or sharing with collaborators. Data can be exported in various formats, including CSV, JSON, and NetCDF, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of scientific software and tools. Additionally, users can share their work with others by publishing their results or creating custom visualizations within the application.</p></li>

<p>In this tutorial, we will explore how to access the data presented in the line graphs related to radiation dose. These graphs provide valuable information on accumulated radiation dose, total radiation dose, South Atlantic anomaly, and galactic cosmic rays. By following the steps below, you can easily access and interpret the data from these graphs.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Scroll down to view the Graphs:</strong> The line graphs are titled “Accumulated Radiation Dose,” “Total Radiation Dose,” “South Atlantic Anomaly,” and “Galactic Cosmic Rays.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand the Data:</strong> Each graph displays a line representing the data points. The x-axis typically represents time, while the y-axis represents the radiation dose or related measurements. Read the titles and labels on the axes to understand what each graph is measuring.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpret the Accumulated Radiation Dose Graph:</strong> Examine the “Accumulated Radiation Dose” graph to observe the trend of accumulated radiation dose over time. Pay attention to any significant changes or patterns in the line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze the Total Radiation Dose Graph:</strong> Study the “Total Radiation Dose” graph to understand the total radiation dose received over time. Compare the total radiation dose with the accumulated radiation dose to identify any differences.</p></li>
