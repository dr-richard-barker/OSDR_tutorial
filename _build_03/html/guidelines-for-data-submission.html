<h1>Data Submission Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#data-submission-guide" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>If your study is funded by NASA and you haven’t completed a Research Data Submission Agreement (RDSA) yet. The RDSA will help you create your study. If you already have an RDSA, your experiment record will have an associated study, and you can create additional studies as needed. Please contact the OSDR data curation team f aor more information <strong>arc-dl-osdr-data&#64;mail.nasa.gov</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Below you will find guidelines for submitting space biology data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Review a Dataset</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://guest.nasa.gov/"><strong>Create an Account</strong> </a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Review Submission Tutorial</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Log into</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission/console">BDME </a> <strong>and create study</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Upload Data Files and Enter Metadata to describe the experimental design.</strong> </p>
<p>OSDR organizes metadata into sample-level information and assay-level information. Data files are uploaded into the workspace and can be associated with each study.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Enter your metadata and upload files directly to <a class="reference external" href="https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission/console">BDME User Interface</a>. Once completed, follow the instructions in the tutorial to submit your study to OSDR Curation for review.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Use the templates below to enter your metadata and submit the completed sample-level and assay-level metadata files to OSDR Curation at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:arc-dl-osdr-data&#37;&#52;&#48;mail&#46;nasa&#46;gov">arc-dl-osdr-data<span>&#64;</span>mail<span>&#46;</span>nasa<span>&#46;</span>gov</a>. Make sure you upload all data files to your <a class="reference external" href="https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/workspace-sso-login.html">workspace</a> so it can be associated with your metadata’s experimental factors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below you will find links to a “sample-level” metadata template and assay-level metadata templates for the most common assay types. Use these to properly format your data prior to submission. If you don’t see your experimental assay in the folder, please contact us so we can add it.</p>

</ul>
<p>When possible, please use common acronyms as defined on the <a class="reference internal" href="open-science-abbreviations.html"><span class="std std-doc">OSDR Abbreviations Page</span></a>. If your data has acronyms, scientific terms, or column names that need to be defined, please include a data dictionary. An example data dictionary can be found in dataset <a class="reference external" href="https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-618">OSD-618</a>, which contains many data files, that contain novel abbreviations that when recognised as OSDR acronyms their full meaning can be deduced using the  <a class="reference internal" href="open-science-abbreviations.html"><span class="std std-doc">OSDR Abbreviations Page</span></a> as a dictionary of meaning.</p>

<p>The Biological Data Management Environment (BDME) is a web-based system that accepts submission of omics data from space-relevant experiments including spaceflight, radiation, simulated gravity, gravitropism, isolation and confinement, hostile closed environments and/or distance from Earth. The OSDR accepts studies whose design, assays and data types match those listed in the homepage, if yours is listed then please contact our curation team to help us add it.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to proceed from here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Option 1: Manuscript-guided auto-populate metadata.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 2: Manually</strong> enter your metadata and upload files directly to <a class="reference external" href="https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission/console">BDME User Interface</a>. Once completed, follow the instructions in the tutorial to submit your study to OSDR Curation for review.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 3:</strong> <strong>Use the templates</strong> below to enter your metadata and submit the completed sample-level and assay-level metadata files to OSDR Curation at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:arc-dl-osdr-data&#37;&#52;&#48;mail&#46;nasa&#46;gov">arc-dl-osdr-data<span>&#64;</span>mail<span>&#46;</span>nasa<span>&#46;</span>gov</a>.

<p>Guided submission offers step-by-step guidance for new users or complex studies but requires a pre-published paper to guide the process. Users can also choose to skip guided submission and directly provide an overview of their study, including purpose, methods, and procedures. Regardless of the chosen path, both options lead to the final step (step 8) where users can review and make necessary changes before submission to the OSDR. Additionally, users can stop at any point and resume editing later, ensuring flexibility throughout the submission process.</p>

<p>The preview button allows users to create a demo OSDR page, the preview page reflects the latest version of your OSD-# page so remember to save the metadata before viewing it. A read-only preview link will also be provided for you to share with your reviewers and/or journals. Use the arrow pointing down to access their account and potentially choose to log out.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Complete metadata validation can take some time to achieve</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#complete-metadata-validation-can-take-some-time-to-achieve" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides a data curation team dedicated to assisting researchers in ensuring the quality and completeness of their metadata entries. This team is available to review and provide guidance on metadata, ensuring that it meets the required standards and best practices.</p>
<p>To initiate the data curation process, researchers can select the “Study Validation” tab within the OSDR platform and click on the “Submit” button. This action triggers a validation test that summarizes the status of the repository, providing valuable insights into any potential issues or areas requiring attention or the addition of more information.</p>
<p>Once the validation test is complete, the status of the study in the left panel will change to “In Curation” or another relevant status, such as “Submitted.” During the curation process, the OSDR curation team will thoroughly review the study metadata, ensuring its accuracy, completeness, and compliance with the repository’s standards.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that once a study enters the curation status, researchers will temporarily lose the ability to make changes to the metadata. This is to ensure the integrity and consistency of the curation process. The OSDR curation team will contact researchers if any missing information is identified or if changes are needed to meet the repository’s curation standards. After the curation team has completed their review, researchers will receive the updated metadata for the final review. This provides an opportunity for researchers to verify the changes made by the curation team and ensure that the metadata accurately represents their study.</p>
