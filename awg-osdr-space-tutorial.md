# AWG OSDR space tutorial

This forum-space is a ![:houses:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/houses.png?v=12) community for OSDR AWG Members. If you are not yet a member, to join please go to: ![:link:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/link.png?v=12)[Join the AWG 19](https://forms.gle/eMDz5fFf2bBg3WPQ6). You then will be contacted by an AWG member and/or chair of an AWG group. Of note when you submit the Join form - you can join any/multiple ![:hugs:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hugs.png?v=12) of the 8 groups (multi-omics, RadLab, animal, plant, microbial, ALSDA, AI/ML, female repro). You then will receive an invite to this forum-space.

That aside, and if you are a member ![:dizzy:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/dizzy.png?v=12) we are so glad you joined us here in this [Discourse 6](https://www.discourse.org/), and welcome to our community’s space. This AWG community is viewed best on the **“Discourse Hub” app (downloadable on your phone’s AppStore iOS or Android/Google Play)** or from a browser. AWG members can now login via your email/password, or through enabling settings to use your Google or GitHub accounts.

Here are some things you can do to get started:

![:speaking\_head:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/speaking\_head.png?v=12) **Introduce yourself** by adding your picture and information about yourself and your interests to [your profile](https://awg.osdr.space/my/preferences/account). Please include your actual name. **Include your profile picture.** I’d also urge you to include your affiliation. What projects would you like to do? What is some of your expertise? Please also add where you are located ![:blush:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=12) ![:memo:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/memo.png?v=12)

![:open\_book:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/open\_book.png?v=12) **Get to know the community** by [browsing discussions 4](https://awg.osdr.space/top) that are already happening here. When you find a post interesting, informative, or entertaining, use the ![:heart:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=12) to show your appreciation or support!

![:thread:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thread.png?v=12) **Complete this tutorial** [Greetings](https://awg.osdr.space/t/greetings/131) to learn about our new forum-space by following the prompts. I estimate it takes \~10min.

![:handshake:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12) **Contribute** by commenting, sharing your own perspective, asking questions, or offering feedback in the discussion. Before replying or starting new topics, please review the [Community Guidelines 3](https://awg.osdr.space/faq). There also is each AWG’s monthly virtual meeting, which is the “face-to-face” time for each AWG. Make sure to post content in your AWG-specific category ![:star\_struck:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/star\_struck.png?v=12)

![:rocket:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12) **The Open Science Data Repository** [(OSDR) 3](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) contains multi-modal and multi-hierarchical fundamental space life science data (omics, phenotypic, physiological, imaging, behavioral, environmental telemetry; tabular, text, code, imaging, video; raw, processed) which is available for reuse toward basic science, applied science, and operational outcomes for space exploration and knowledge discovery.

There also is a ![:scroll:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/scroll.png?v=12)[**Charter** 6](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/charter.html) which all AWG Members should review and be familiar with. There also is an OSDR newsletter, [subscribe here 3](https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/sl/NIjXkcl).

**Analysis Working Group (AWG)** members overall engage in two main activities connected to the OSDR.

* One, members **provide feedback** on scientific standards for reuse (subject and assay metadata; processing pipelines; dataset formats and uniformed structures for machine-readability).
* Two, AWG members **collaborate to mine-reuse OSDR data** to conduct scientific analysis, which often leads to peer-reviewed publications.

This site is a place to:

* Find different projects and engage with others
* Find all 8 AWG communities (multi-omics, RadLab, animal, plant, microbial, ALSDA, AI/ML, female repro)
* Find details on each AWG’s monthly meeting and links to notes
* Find details on each AWG’s subgroups and various GitHub code repos
* Ask questions on submission, curation, and data/metadata standards
* Discuss and post various science articles
* Learn about events, opportunities, announcements related to space biology, space health, space data, and open science
* Provide feedback on updates/edits needed on datasets (visit the [Category: Dataset Issues](https://awg.osdr.space/t/about-the-dataset-issues-category/50) and post your feedback/comment/issue)
