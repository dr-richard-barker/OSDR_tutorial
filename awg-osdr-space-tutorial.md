### Navigating the AWG OSDR Space: A Guide for Space Biology Researchers

The AWG OSDR Space is an online community for space biology researchers using the Discourse platform to foster communication and collaboration. This tutorial will guide you through accessing and using this valuable resource. The Open Science Data Repository has a new forum space (platform) to communicate efficiently within and between all AWGs. For this reason, we encourage you [to register with this link](https://awg.osdr.space/). If you don't receive this email, or if any questions emerge, please contact Ryan Scott ([ryan.t.scott@nasa.gov](mailto:ryan.t.scott@nasa.gov)).

**Prerequisites:**

* [Register with this link](https://awg.osdr.space/).&#x20;
* Basic understanding of online forums.
* Affiliation with a space biology research institution or project.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Request Access:** Contact the AWG OSDR administrators to request access to the online forum. They will likely require verification of your affiliation with space biology research.
2. **Join the Discourse Platform:** Once approved, you'll receive instructions on joining the AWG OSDR Space on the Discourse platform. This might involve creating a new Discourse account or using your existing login credentials from another Discourse forum.

**Using the AWG OSDR Space:**

1. **Interface:** Upon logging in, you'll find a user-friendly interface with categories, topics (discussions), and posts. Categories  are organized by research areas, missions, or project-specific discussions.
2. **Browsing Topics:** Explore existing topics by browsing categories or using the search bar. You can find ongoing discussions relevant to your research interests.
3. **Reading and Participating:** Read through existing discussions to learn about current research, ongoing projects, and questions from fellow space biology researchers.
4. **Posting and Replies:** If you have a question, want to share your research findings, or participate in ongoing discussions, you can create a new topic or reply to existing posts. Be sure to choose the appropriate category for your topic.
5. **Search Functionality:** Utilize the search bar to find specific topics, discussions, or keywords mentioned within the AWG OSDR Space.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Introduce Yourself:** In your initial posts, consider introducing yourself and your research area to the community.
* **Search Before Posting:** Before creating a new topic, check if a similar discussion already exists using the search function.
* **Stay Informed:** Enable notification settings to receive updates on replies to your posts or new discussions in your areas of interest.
* **Professional Conduct:** Maintain a professional and respectful tone in your interactions within the forum.

By following these steps and tips, you can effectively navigate the AWG OSDR Space and connect with the space biology research community. Remember, this platform serves as a valuable tool for sharing knowledge, fostering collaboration, and staying updated on the latest advancements in the field.
